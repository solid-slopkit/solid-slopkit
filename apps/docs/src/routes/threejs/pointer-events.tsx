      <p>
        On each pointer event over the canvas, a ray is cast from the Active camera through the pointer, against the Interactive
        Instances (those with a handler) and everything under them. Whether an Instance is Interactive is decided once, when it
        mounts. An Instance with no handler neither gets events nor blocks them; a hit on one goes to the nearest Instance above
        it that has a handler.
      </p>

      <H2 id="delivery">Delivery</H2>
      <p>
        Every hit gets the event, nearest first: the hit Instance, then its ancestors with handlers, then the next hit. Each
        Instance gets an event once. <code>event.stopPropagation()</code> ends delivery.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <code>onPointerEnter</code> and <code>onPointerLeave</code> run on each Instance that becomes hovered or stops being
          hovered, and don't bubble. <code>onPointerOver</code> and <code>onPointerOut</code> run when the nearest hovered
          Instance changes, and bubble.
        </li>
        <li>Handlers are read when their event is delivered, so they can change. They're never written to the Instance.</li>
      </ul>

      <H2 id="drags">Drags</H2>
      <p>
        Call <code>event.setPointerCapture()</code> in <code>onPointerDown</code>. Until the pointer is lifted, its moves reach
        the Instance (and its ancestors with handlers) even off it, with no <code>intersection</code> when they miss.
